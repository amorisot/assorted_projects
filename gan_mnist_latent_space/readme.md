The purpose of this project was to create a GAN, train it on MNIST, and make a video of it moving through its best approximation of MNIST's data manifold. By picking two points in latent space, linearly interpolating between them, and using the GAN to project those points into pixel space, you can make videos like `images/output.mp4`. That video is the GAN forcing itself to stay as close as possible to the probability distribution of the data it was trained on (images of digits).
