This repository contains the pdf of my M.Sc. thesis on fair classification, as well as most of the experiments I performed (described in more detail in code_and_plots/readme2.md). The code is extremely messy.

It's not too closely related to what anomalous is doing, and involves no deep learning (only logistic regression, unfortunately). I included it here because the report is a good example of the types of report that I can write, and the subject matter may be of interest to you (I know it is to Euan Gardner!)
